## **Proxy Server Definition**

A **proxy server** is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an [IP address](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-ip-address). This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.

**Proxy Servers and Network Security**

Proxies provide a valuable layer of security for your computer. They can be set up as web filters or [firewall](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/firewall-defined)s, protecting your computer from [internet threats](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/internet-security) like [malware](https://www.fortinet.com/content/fortinet-com/en_us).

This extra security is also valuable when coupled with a [secure web gateway](https://www.fortinet.com/products/secure-web-gateway) or other [email security](https://www.fortinet.com/products/email-security) products. This way, you can filter traffic according to its level of safety or how much traffic your network—or individual computers—can handle.

How to use a proxy? Some people use proxies for personal purposes, such as hiding their location while watching movies online, for example. For a company, however, they can be used to accomplish several key tasks such as:

1. Improve security
2. Secure employees’ internet activity from people trying to snoop on them
3. Balance internet traffic to prevent crashes
4. Control the websites employees and staff access in the office
5. Save bandwidth by [caching files](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-caching) or compressing incoming traffic
